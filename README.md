# Thief Detection Using NextJs And TensorFlow.js

The Thief Detection project leverages the power of Next.js, a React framework for server-side rendering, and TensorFlow.js, a JavaScript library for training and deploying machine learning models, to create a real-time thief detection system. This web application is designed to monitor video feeds and identify suspicious activities or individuals, providing enhanced security measures for homes and businesses.

## Features

- **Real-Time Video Monitoring:**
  - Live streaming from IP cameras or webcams
  - Video playback for reviewing recorded footage

- **Machine Learning-Based Detection:**
  - Object detection using TensorFlow.js
  - Suspicious activity identification

- **Alert System:**
  - Instant notifications via email, SMS, or push notifications
  - Alert dashboard for managing and viewing alerts

- **User Authentication and Access Control:**
  - Secure login and user authentication
  - Role-based access control

- **Data Management:**
  - Event logging with detailed metadata
  - Secure storage for video footage and logs

- **User-Friendly Interface:**
  - Intuitive dashboard for monitoring and settings
  - Customizable detection sensitivity and alert criteria

- **Scalability and Performance:**
  - Efficient processing for multiple video feeds
  - Scalable architecture for handling high-resolution feeds
